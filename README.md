# Creditcard

Credit Card Payments with Reactive Froms as a Proof of Concept for How to handle forms with angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.4.

## Notes

* Froms in General

> 1- They are created by grouping together a series of inputs, checkboxes, selects, etc
>
> 2- Froms need Validators
>
> 3- Froms hasHelp messages to help the user along
>
> 4- Froms need to be updated rapidly, no hard-coded froms
>
> 5- ANGULAR has to separte and different systems for building forms

* Reactive Froms vs Template forms:
    >- Reactive Forms is long term solution and implmented in the **component class file** and wired up with **ReactiveFromsMoudle**
    >
    >- Template Froms is less complex but harder to deal with dynamic forms (adding/ removing), implmented in the **component template file** and wired up with **FromsModule**

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
